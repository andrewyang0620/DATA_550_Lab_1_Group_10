    "First, I just want to thank you for bringing me back to my senses and stopping my world domination attempt and silly startup idea. I don't know what happen, but I clearly wasn't myself there for a while. Now that you have brought me back to normal, I would like design this lab more similar to the first one and go through a topic that I find intriguing and ponder-worthy.\n",

    "This time, instead of looking around us, we will look inside. Ever since I arrived on this planet, I have been fascinated about your use of airborn oscillations to transmit information generated by electrical impulses. And the fact that you rely on muscular dexterity for the encoding process as well as passive mechnotransduction for the decoding is truly remarkable (in a primitive sense of course, I guess how your kind can appreciate \"the remarkable complexity\" of a cave painting). Such a system is clearly a bottleneck in terms of information bandwidth and I am surprised a more direct means of intercranial transmission never evolved here, but from the perspective of my research on less evolved galactic lifeforms I find this fascinating!\n",

    "After hearing that there are over 7,000 languages spoken across this globe, I am curious whether some of these at least allow for more rapid information transmission than others. The implications of this reach beyond just communication as I have recently learned that you also restrict many of your thoughts to those that can be expressed in words (again, fascinating!). This means that you could literally upgrade your thought throughput by learning a new language. And it could mean that there are groups of people who have access to faster thinking others, just because their language can convey information at a higher rate, what an enormous advantage!"

    "These results are looking pretty promising, now we just need to add a narrative so that it will be easy for others to follow along with what we have done here. Tell a story using the three plots we have created. Build it up according to the principles and examples from this week's required readings. In your story you can refer to the plots as plot A,B, and C. You story should make it clear what the plot is telling us and how it motivates the next plot we're making so that there is a clear story line for the reader to follow as well as a clear take home message (there might be many messages in these plots, so you can choose which to focus on). No need to write an essay here, a succinct paragraph per plot should do it.\n",

    "A - is about information density vs the number of distinct syllables for each language. We can see that asian languages tend to have fewer syllables but higher information density, while European languages have more distinct syllables but lower information density. Mandarin, Japanese, French, and Basque shows that some languages are different from other. Overall there seems to be a trade-off between how many syllables a language uses and how much information each syllable has.\n",
    "\n",
    "B - is about information density vs speech rate for each language. We can see that languages with higher information density tend to be spoken more slowly. This means that the total information transmitted/s is similar across languages, so no particular language group appears clearly more efficient at conveying information. \n",
    "\n",
    "C - is about information rate for each language. We can see that the information rate is similar across languages, with most languages conveying around 30-50 bits/s. Overall, this suggests that human mind have a limit and pattern on how much information they can process per second."

This could mean that certain thought patterns and emotions might be more accessible in languages where they are more easily verbalized, and maybe we would have slightly different thoughts if we knew another language (the reference here is the weak form of the Sapiro-Whorf hypothesis of linguistic relativity, not the strong version). After you are done with the lab, I recommend listening to [this talk by Lera Boroditsky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RKK7wGAYP6k) or watching the movie \"Arrival\" (although they go a bit far...) if you are interested in learning more about this (it's fun to think about!)."
